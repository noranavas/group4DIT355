# SOURCE CODE MODELER

Source Code Modeler is a software that allows developers to visualize source code into a diagram similar to a UML class diagram.
The primary purpose of the system is to convert a Java project into a visualization that can provide and overview of the structure of the project. The visualization will take the form of a diagram with similar but not identical syntax as a UML class diagram. Our system will only provide an indication that two components relate to each other, without specifying different types of relationships. The output diagram will provide developers with an overview of the project’s structure.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- A computer with Windows installed.
- A router (It doesn’t work on public networks)
- Windows firewall needs to be turned off before running the program.
- In order to produce the visualization, Graphviz needs to be previously installed locally. Link: https://graphviz.gitlab.io/ 

### Installing


- Pull the latest version.
- Connect to the router. All the different nodes should be connected to the same router.
- Turn off windows firewall.
- Provide the 3 Ip addresses of the different 3 nodes on the class IPRepository.java.
